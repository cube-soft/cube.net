You can get the executable installer from the [download page](https://www.cube-soft.jp/cuberssreader/index.php) (Japanese), or [directly download link](https://www.cube-soft.jp/cuberssreader/dl.php).
We currently show menus and other messages only in Japanese, and support for other languages are one of our future works...
